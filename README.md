Introduction
------------
LibCGI is a simple to use yet powerful library written from scratch to assist in the making of CGI appliactions in C. It has support for string manipulation, linked lists, cookies, sessions, GET and POST methods and more.

It was my first Open Source project, somewhere back in the 2000s and somethings. Originally it was hosted at Sourceforge. 

Building
--------
* Type _./configure_ and then _make_
* To clean, type _make clean_
* To remove library files, type _make uninstall_
* At the _examples/_ directory you'll find some code to start with

TODO
----
Well, I am keeping this TODO list here for historical (and funny) reasons. Nowadays I don't have any plans to enhance or change anything. 

- Template Engine
- Mime functions
- Encrypted session
- Memory Management functions
- Code speed ups
- Other miscelaneous functions
- Win32 port? ( who wants it? )
